# Navigation 

## Basics

To get started, think of your documentation as a collection of individual pages. Each page represents a topic or section of your documentation. 
When creating a new page, you'll need to provide a unique identifier called a "slug" in the markdown frontmatter. 
This slug will determine the URL of the page and its place in the navigation structure.

Additionally, it's important to provide a meaningful title for each page in the frontmatter. 
This title will be used as the name of the corresponding menu item in the navigation.

While the slug and title properties are essential for creating a robust navigation structure, we also support a fallback system based on folders and filenames. 
If you don't provide a slug for a page, the system will generate one based on the folder structure. In this case make sure that every topic folder contains an `index.mdx` file that serves as a topic content page.
However, we encourage content writers to provide a slug in the frontmatter to have more control over the URL and navigation structure.

This is how the frontmatter of the current page looks like:  
```frontmatter
---
title: Navigation
slug: /user-guide/navigation
---
```

## Main menu and sidebar navigation

The navigation structure is automatically generated based on the pages you create. 
The main menu will display the top-level topics, with each topic represented by a specific page. 
This ensures that every menu item corresponds to a page, providing a seamless and intuitive browsing experience for your users.

The the sidebar menu focuses on the current topic, showing the relevant pages within that branch.

If you want to fine-tune the navigation display, you have the option to disable the branch-based filtering. This will show all the pages across all topics in the sidebar menu, with the current page highlighted.  
Your development team can disable the branch-based filtering for sidebar navigation by adding `showFullNavigation: true` to the DocsKit theme options.

To enhance navigation within each page, a table of contents (ToC) is automatically generated based on the headings you use. 
By structuring your content with headings like "Section 1" and "Subsection A," the ToC will be generated accordingly.

## Customization

We understand that flexibility is important, so you have the option to customize the appearance of your pages. 
You can choose to turn off the sidebar menu and/or the table of contents for specific pages, allowing you to focus solely on the content.
You can do this by addign `hideNavigation: true` or `hideToc: true` to the page frontmatter:
```frontmatter
---
title: My full-width page
slug: /full-width-page
hideNavigation: true
hideToc: true
```

## Summary

By providing slugs and titles for your pages, you can create a clear and intuitive navigation structure.
Users will easily find the information they need, with each menu item corresponding to a dedicated page. 
Additionally, the generated table of contents enhances navigation within each page, further improving the user experience.

Start creating your well-structured documentation site, ensuring that each topic has its own dedicated page with a unique slug and meaningful title. 
This will enable your users to navigate seamlessly through your valuable content, enhancing their learning and discovery process.
