# What is markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to easily format text using simple syntax. 
It was designed with simplicity and readability in mind, making it a popular choice for creating documentation, blog posts, and other types of content.
With Markdown, you can add headings, lists, links, images, code blocks, and more to your text, all using plain text with minimal effort.

While Markdown provides a great foundation for creating content, sometimes you may need additional flexibility and interactivity. 
That's where MDX comes in. MDX is an extension of Markdown that allows you to embed JSX (JavaScript XML) components within your Markdown documents. 
This powerful combination enables you to seamlessly combine static content with dynamic elements, such as interactive code snippets, data visualizations, or even embedded videos.

With MDX, you can take your documentation to the next level by incorporating interactive examples, live demos, or custom components that enhance the learning experience for your users.
It provides a bridge between the simplicity of Markdown and the power of JavaScript, giving you the best of both worlds.
