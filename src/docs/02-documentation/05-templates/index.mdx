# Templates

Templates are crucial tools in creating effective documentation. These outlines come complete with standard content, placeholders, and instructions, providing a solid framework for creating your content. The fact that they're written in the MDX format that DocsKit uses means that they can also serve as useful guides for those new to the language, helping them grasp its syntax more quickly.

But the value of templates goes beyond merely simplifying the writing process. They ensure that there's consistency and structure throughout your documentation. They guide contributors on what information to include, how to present it, and how to link to related topics.

When we were developing our own documentation, we began with three main types of content: tutorials, concepts, and references, all inspired by topic-based authoring. As our content needs expanded, we created additional templates for things like release notes and use cases, demonstrating how versatile and adaptable templates can be.
