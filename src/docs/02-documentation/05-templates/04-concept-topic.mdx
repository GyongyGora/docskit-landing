# Concept Topic
Concept topics serve as the building blocks in understanding a product. They provide essential background information that users need before they can dive into your product's features. These topics take key ideas or main themes from your product and break them down into understandable chunks. They go beyond just explaining what something is, offering examples and additional context to help users see how these concepts work in real life.

Concept topics also make use of visual aids like diagrams or graphics. These can make complex ideas easier to grasp by breaking them down into simpler parts. They also serve to highlight important points, making the learning process more effective.Additionally, concept topics can show how different ideas are linked together. This gives users a broader understanding of the product, helping them see how each part fits into the overall picture.

In essence, concept topics form the groundwork for users to navigate and utilize the product efficiently. They make learning about a new product less daunting and more accessible, fostering confidence in users.
