# Reference Topic
Reference topics in documentation are comprehensive resources that support users while performing tasks with your product. They offer concrete, fact-based information that is frequently referenced rather than memorized, such as a REST API reference. 

These topics often come in the form of lists and tables that organize data for easy access and readability. They are designed to serve as quick, go-to guides for users who need to look up specific details or parameters.

**Find the templates for API Reference Introduction page and Endpoint pages within the DocsKit package.**
