# Step 5: Merging your changes

![Editorial workflow Step 5](./assets/Editorial_workflow_5.png)

Once your topic is approved and both you and your reviewers find the content finalized, you can proceed to **merge the pull request** using GitHub's merge button or command-line Git.
After merging, the changes become part of the target branch, and the pull request is closed.
