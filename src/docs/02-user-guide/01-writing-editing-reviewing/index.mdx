# Writing, Editing, Reviewing


![Editorial workflow Flowchart](./assets/editorial_workflow.png)

DocsKit follows the **Docs as Code** approach, where technical documentation is treated like software code, applying version control, collaboration, and automation principles to improve the quality and efficiency of documentation processes.

This guide provides you with the tools you need to write, edit, and review your documentation topics, and demonstrates the recommended Docs as Code Workflow:


[Step 1: Writing your content](/user-guide/writing-editing-reviewing/step-1-writing)

[Step 2: Submitting your content](/user-guide/writing-editing-reviewing/step-2-submitting)

[Step 3: Reviewing the content](/user-guide/writing-editing-reviewing/step-3-reviewing)

[Step 4: Editing your content based on feedback](/user-guide/writing-editing-reviewing/step-4-editing)

[Step 5: Merging your changes](/user-guide/writing-editing-reviewing/step-5-merging)

[Step 6: Deploying the final content](/user-guide/writing-editing-reviewing/step-6-deploying)
