# Step 2: Submitting your content

![Editorial workflow Step 2](./assets/Editorial_workflow_2.png)

When you finish writing your content in your editor, submit the new topic as a pull request on GitHub. This will notify the team to start the review process.

**Tip:** [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) is advisable to use when you want a user-friendly, graphical interface for interacting with Git and GitHub repositories. It is beneficial for individuals who are new to Git and version control. It provides an intuitive and easy-to-understand interface, making it less intimidating for beginners. GitHub Desktop is available for Windows and macOS, offering a consistent experience across both operating systems.


### Git Workflow
