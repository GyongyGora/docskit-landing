# Theming and Customization

## Default theme

Docskit comes with a fully customizable, accessible responsive theme.  

Main Features:
- SEO-ready
- Accessible 
- Responsive
- Optimized images 
- Pre-designed components  
- Automatically generated navigation, table of contents, breadcrumbs


## Custom color scheme 

The DocsKit theme uses Gatsby's [Shadowing API](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/plugins-and-themes/shadowing/).  
This means that you can provide your own color scheme by implementing the `src/@platformos/gatsby-theme-platformos-docskit/theme/colors.js` file in your DocsKit application's source code.
The color scheme configuration file is a javascript object that defines the theme colors in RGB format:
```javascript
module.exports = {
  "prominent": "0, 0, 0",
  "normal": "55, 65, 81",
  "supplementary": "107, 114, 128",
  ...
}
```
The naming and the format comes from platformOS's public design system: [The platformOS DesignKit](https://documentation.platformos.com/kits/ui/platformos-design-kit)



## Custom components

You can use the Shadowing API to extend or override the built-in DocsKit Components.
If you want to create a different version of the <Button>Button</Button> component or you need a new variant, you can copy the original component file from the *node_modules* folder to `src/@platformos/gatsby-theme-platformos-docskit/components/button.js` and add your customizations.  

Gatsby will use your custom button everywhere in the application after you restart the development server or build the application.  

This gives you absolute control over the look and feel of your custom DocsKit documentation site.
