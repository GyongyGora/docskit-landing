# What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that enables easy text formatting using simple syntax. It was created with a focus on simplicity and readability, making it a popular option for generating documentation, blog posts, and various other types of content. Markdown allows you to incorporate headings, lists, links, images, code blocks, and more into your text, all through plain text with minimal effort.

While Markdown serves as an excellent foundation for content creation, there may be instances where additional flexibility and interactivity are required. This is where MDX comes into play. MDX is an extension of Markdown that allows the embedding of JSX (JavaScript XML) components within Markdown documents. This powerful combination enables the seamless integration of static content with dynamic elements, such as interactive code snippets, data visualizations, or even embedded videos.

By utilizing MDX, you can elevate your documentation by incorporating interactive examples, live demos, or custom components that enhance the learning experience for your users. It serves as a bridge between the simplicity of Markdown and the power of JavaScript, offering you the best of both worlds.
