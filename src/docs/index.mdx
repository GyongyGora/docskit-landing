## Our inspiration: the platformOS Documentation

    The [platformOS Documentation](https://documentation.platformos.com) provides onboarding, conceptual information, tutorials, examples, API references, use cases, and best practices to developers building their apps or sites on the Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) framework that is platformOS. 

    Following the Docs as Code approach, it is built to accommodate constant iteration and collaboration — with our developer community being involved in all phases of our editorial workflow, the portal is quick to adapt to their ever evolving needs.
